# ðŸ§© **Django Models and Relationships**  

---

## ðŸ”¹ 1. What is a Django Model?

A **Model** in Django is a **Python class** that defines the structure of your database tables.
Each attribute in the class represents a **field** in the database.

In essence, Models are the **blueprints** for your database.

---

### âœ… Example:

```python
from django.db import models

class Student(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=200, unique = True)
    age = models.IntegerField()
    email = models.EmailField(unique=True)
    date_registered = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
```

Each time you run migrations, Django creates a table like this in the database:

| id | name | age | email                                       | date_registered |
| -- | ---- | --- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| 1  | John | 22  | [john@example.com](mailto:john@example.com) | 2025-10-21      |

---

## ðŸ”¹ 2. Fields in Django Models

Common field types:

| Field Type                | Description               | Example                                       |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `CharField(max_length=n)` | Short text                | Name, title                                   |
| `TextField()`             | Long text                 | Description, content                          |
| `IntegerField()`          | Whole numbers             | Age, quantity                                 |
| `FloatField()`            | Decimal numbers           | Price, score                                  |
| `BooleanField()`          | True/False                | Active status                                 |
| `DateField()`             | Stores date               | Birthday                                      |
| `DateTimeField()`         | Stores date and time      | Created date                                  |
| `EmailField()`            | Email validation          | [email@example.com](mailto:email@example.com) |
| `FileField()`             | File uploads              | Profile photo                                 |
| `ImageField()`            | Image uploads             | Avatar                                        |
| `ForeignKey()`            | One-to-Many relationship  | Author of a post                              |
| `ManyToManyField()`       | Many-to-Many relationship | Students and Courses                          |
| `OneToOneField()`         | One-to-One relationship   | User â†” Profile                                |

---

## ðŸ”¹ 3. Creating and Applying Migrations

After creating a model:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

This creates and applies database tables.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 4. Django ORM (Object Relational Mapper)

Django ORM lets you interact with the database using **Python code** â€” no need for raw SQL.

### Example:

```python
# Create
student = Student.objects.create(name="John", age=22, email="john@gmail.com")

# Read
students = Student.objects.all()

# Filter
young_students = Student.objects.filter(age__lt=25)

# Update
student.name = "John Doe"
student.save()

# Delete
student.delete()
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ 5. Relationships Between Models

### There are three main types of relationships:

| Relationship                 | Description                                                              | Example            |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| **One-to-One**               | A single record in one model is linked to one record in another model.   | User â†” Profile     |
| **One-to-Many (ForeignKey)** | A single record in one model is linked to multiple records in another.   | Teacher â†’ Students |
| **Many-to-Many**             | Multiple records in one model are linked to multiple records in another. | Students â†” Courses |

---

## ðŸ”¸ A. One-to-One Relationship

Used when **each record in Model A** relates to **exactly one record in Model B**.

### Example:

User â†” Profile

```python
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from django.db import models

class Profile(models.Model):
    user = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    phone = models.CharField(max_length=15)
    address = models.CharField(max_length=200)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.user.username
```

**Explanation:**

* `on_delete=models.CASCADE`: if the user is deleted, the profile is also deleted.
* Each user has exactly one profile.

---

## ðŸ”¸ B. One-to-Many Relationship (ForeignKey)

Used when **one record** in a model relates to **many** in another model.

### Example:

Teacher â†’ Students

```python
class Teacher(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    subject = models.CharField(max_length=100)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name

class Student(models.Model):
    teacher = models.ForeignKey(Teacher, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='students')
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    age = models.IntegerField()

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
```

**Usage:**

```python
# Fetch teacher's students
teacher = Teacher.objects.get(id=1)
students = teacher.students.all()
```

---

## ðŸ”¸ C. Many-to-Many Relationship

Used when multiple records in one model relate to multiple records in another.

### Example:

Students â†” Courses

```python
class Course(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    code = models.CharField(max_length=10)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name

class Student(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    courses = models.ManyToManyField(Course, related_name='students')

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
```

**Usage:**

```python
# Add course to student
course = Course.objects.get(id=1)
student = Student.objects.get(id=2)
student.courses.add(course)

# View student's courses
student.courses.all()

# View all students in a course
course.students.all()
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ 6. Model Meta Options

You can customize model behavior using the `Meta` class inside your model.

```python
class Student(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

    class Meta:
        ordering = ['name']
        verbose_name_plural = "Students"
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ 7. Model Methods

You can define custom methods inside models for extra logic.

```python
class Student(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    marks = models.IntegerField()

    def is_passed(self):
        return self.marks >= 40
```

Usage:

```python
student = Student.objects.get(id=1)
student.is_passed()   # True or False
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ 8. Choices Field Example

When a field should only accept certain options:

```python
class Student(models.Model):
    GENDER_CHOICES = [
        ('M', 'Male'),
        ('F', 'Female'),
    ]
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    gender = models.CharField(max_length=1, choices=GENDER_CHOICES)
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ 9. Working with File and Image Fields

```python
class Document(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    file = models.FileField(upload_to='documents/')
    uploaded_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```

Make sure you set in **settings.py**:

```python
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
MEDIA_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'media'
```

And in **urls.py**:

```python
from django.conf import settings
from django.conf.urls.static import static

urlpatterns = [
    ...
] + static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ 10. Related Names and QuerySets

The `related_name` attribute allows reverse access to relationships.

Example:

```python
teacher.students.all()
```

comes from `related_name='students'`.

Without it, Django defaults to `student_set`.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 11. Model Inheritance

Django allows **model inheritance** for shared fields.

### Example:

```python
class Person(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    age = models.IntegerField()

    class Meta:
        abstract = True  # No table for Person

class Teacher(Person):
    subject = models.CharField(max_length=50)

class Student(Person):
    grade = models.CharField(max_length=10)
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ 12. Using Django Admin for Models

Register models in `admin.py`:

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Student, Teacher, Course

admin.site.register(Student)
admin.site.register(Teacher)
admin.site.register(Course)
```

Now you can manage them visually at:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ 13. Real-World Example (School Management System)

### Models

* **Teacher** â†’ teaches many **Students** (ForeignKey)
* **Student** â†’ takes many **Courses** (ManyToMany)
* **Profile** â†’ belongs to one **User** (OneToOne)

This combination is exactly how you structure complex systems like hospital management, e-commerce, or edutech platforms.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Learning Outcomes**

After this module, students should be able to:
âœ… Define and migrate Django models.
âœ… Use Django ORM for CRUD operations.
âœ… Establish and manage all three relationship types.
âœ… Customize models with Meta and methods.
âœ… Handle files, images, and choices.
âœ… Navigate relationships in both directions.
